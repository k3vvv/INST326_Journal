Week 1

My main source of AI for this week is ChatGPT. I have not used the other AI services yet but I plan to as the course moves forward. 
So as I was going over the week 1 exercises, I used ChatGPT to refresh on some concepts of Python I have not used for a while.
For example, I needed a reminder on how to print a float integer and change its decimal place. I really liked how chatGPT created useful options for me even when I was looking for only one specific function.
The other options helped me go back to them and use them when I found a similar problem on a later exercise. Here is my chat history so far, it converted our conversation into a PDF: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17_Uql80hFCkoxHgMyrS_V6fm2zFhmXO3/view?usp=sharing
Overall I had a great experience with AI and I will test the other AI services to see which works best for me.

Week 2

My main source of AI was still ChatGPT this week. I still havent had the chance to use the other AI services I mentioned during week 1 but I am promising myself that I will use a different source. The week 02 exercises were a bit more challenging for me and I had to review the concepts of a lot of python functions like loops, index, append, and remove. The concepts themselves are easy to understand, but when it comes to incorperating them into lists it can be difficult if you want a specific detail to be added or removed. After week 2's exercises I can definitely see how lists are used to keep track of inventory. I believe that many of these functions will be used with my teams project.

Week 3

I used Claude more this week and also used it to help me with math equations. I think it has better visuals compared to chat GPT which helps me because I am a visual
learner. With the recent reviews I notice that I am falling a bit behind on some python concepts, and I plan to really focus on my weak points and keep practicing and
improving. I think the most important thing about learning to code is practice. Sometimes I get too lazy and I only spend a short amount of time coding, when there
are a lot more things to explore and learn when it comes to python.

Week 4

I went back to Chat GPT and used it to help with some of the class and objects exercises. What is really helping me is using the study option in ChatGPT so that it
goes over a concept step by step to make sure you understand. I like how ChatGPT can ask me questions to check my understanding. I also having been using a textbook to help me understand classes and objects. Python Crash Course third edition by Eric Matthes has really been helping me. What I do is I go over each example and write it myself in Python. I am trying to practice in Python for at least 1 hour a day. What I want to test out next is if ChatGPT can design a game using Python code without my input and with only my ideas. I saw a YouTube video once where someone used AI to create a horror game from scratch.
